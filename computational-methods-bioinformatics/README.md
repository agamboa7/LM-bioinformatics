# Computational Methods for Bioinformatics

This folder contains a collection of exercises completed as part of the course **"Computational Methods for Bioinformatics"**, taught by **Professor Ivan Lanese** and **Professor Matteo Manfredi** at the **University of Bologna** during the **first semester** of my master's degree.

The course served as an introduction to programming with **Python**, specifically tailored to bioinformatics applications. 


## Disclaimer

These exercises were completed during my initial exposure to Python programming. While they are functional and reflect the effort I put in at the time, I now recognize that there are more optimal and efficient ways to implement many of the solutions.

This folder is meant to document my learning journey and growth, and I’ve intentionally left the original code untouched as a reference point of my progress.

Feel free to explore the code, and don’t hesitate to suggest improvements or point out better approaches — I’m always eager to learn more!
